## Lab Notes

- Write out the responsibilities of each class
  - Responsibility - Goal of a class that is achieved by both methods and attributes of a class
    - The methods and variables working together to achieve a purpose
    - It is sometimes hard to tell the responsibilities apart
      - Good because it means that you make a cohesive class
    - This should be considered as the "meaning" of the class IN THE DOMAIN (no programming terms)
    - Example: A car has wheels -> everything related to wheels should be done in the Car class
