 * The BabyBee is a type of bee that is a small bee. It has a small amount of energy, but itâ€™s faster and has a
 * smaller collision area. It has the same responsibilities as a bee, but it has defined properties and the
 * additional responsibility of handling the bee's ability to grow up if it is reaches maximum health.
